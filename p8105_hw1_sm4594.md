# Problem 1.

Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 8
  - a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "the", "first", "data", "science", "homework", "assignment"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three", "one", "two"))
)
```

Take the mean of each variable in the data frame
    above:

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.3069049

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We are able to take the mean of the random sample as well as the logical
vector, but we are unable to take the mean of the character and factor
vectors.

Convert logical, character, and factor variables to numeric:

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos)) 

  as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

After applying the as.numeric function, the logical vector is assigned
values of 1 and 0, with 1 indicating that an element of the sample is
greater than 0 and 0 indicating that an element of the sample is not
greater than 0. The factor vector is assigned values of one, two, or
three, indicating which of the three factor levels an element belongs
to. Now that these variables are assigned numeric values, we are able to
take the mean.

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    sample by the result

  - convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random
    sample by the result

  - convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result
    to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result Problem 2

``` r
  log_num = as.numeric(
    pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))

  log_num * (pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))

\#Problem 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

  - x: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
  - y: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether x + y \> 1
  - a numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
  - a factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

<!-- end list -->

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_logical = x + y > 1,
  vec_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical),
  vec_factor = as.factor(vec_logical)
)
```

There are 500 rows and 5 columns in the dataset. The mean, median, and
standard deviation of x are 0.0275509, -0.0113039 and 0.9874175,
respectively. The proportion of cases for which x + y \> 1 is 0.23

Make a scatterplot of y vs. x; color points using logical
variable:

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical)) + geom_point()
```

Make a scatterplot of y vs. x; color points using numeric
variable:

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_numeric )) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_sm4594_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Make third scatterplot of y vs. x; color points using factor
variable:

``` r
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_factor )) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_sm4594_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- --> The
logical and factor variables have a value of either TRUE or FALSE.
Therefore, in the first and third scatterplots, the blue dots represent
the cases for which the statment x + y \> 1 is true, and the red dots
represent the cases for which the statment x + y \> 1 is false.

The second graph has a color scale ranging from 0 to 1. However, we only
see two colors, the dark and light blue representing 0 and 1. This is
because 0 and 1 are the only two possible values for the numeric
variable; they correspond to the TRUE and FALSE values of the logical
variable that was coerced to create the numeric variable.

Exporting first scatterpolot to project directory:

``` r
ggsave("problem2_df.pdf")
```
