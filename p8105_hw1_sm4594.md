# Problem 1.

Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 8
  - a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "the", "first", "data", "science", "homework", "assignment"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three", "one", "two"))
)
```

Take the mean of each variable in the data frame
    above:

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.08998575

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
  mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

We are able to take the mean of the random sample as well as the logical
vector, but we are unable to take the mean of the character and factor
vectors.
