# Problem 1.

Create a data frame comprised of:

  - a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
  - a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
  - a character vector of length 8
  - a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

<!-- end list -->

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  vec_char = c("This", "is", "the", "first", "data", "science", "homework", "assignment"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three", "one", "two"))
)
```
